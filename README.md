Atom Column Indexing
---------------------------

This folder contains matlab files that load an example RevSTEM image and then fit atom columns in STEM image using 2D Gaussian distribution and then index the atom columns to a matrix representation.

The matlab file "ACI_flow.m" contains the sections that can run in sequence by using the command "Run section" in Matlab software. The same result should be expected as shown in "html/ACI_flow.html".
